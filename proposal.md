## Project description and details

### Description

Our blogging platform, 404, will provide a place in which people can host their blog for free and write posts. Our product will target developers and allow them to style posts with the markdown semantic language.

Registered users will be able to create posts, and comment/like posts, while unregistered users are only able to browse.

### Requirement list

- For visualization of our requirements, we have made a couple of wireframes that display our minimum viable product from the client view.

<b>Note:</b> <br/>
As we move forward, we will <br/>
be fleshing out these ideas more <br/>
and might add more abstraction stages.
</aside>

- Verbally, we are separating our work in several abstraction stages:
  - **Abstraction Stage 1**:
    - View trending posts.
    - Search posts.
    - Login to account.
    - Create account.
    - Make a post.
    - View post.
    - Edit and delete post.
    - Like and comment on posts.
    - User profile, which includes:
      - making a bio,
      - choosing a profile picture from defaults.
  - **Abstraction Stage 2**:
    - Retrieve forgotten password.
    - Change username.
    - Subscribe to other users.
    - Add photos to posts.
    - Preview the markdown.
    - Allow text styling without markdown.
    - LaTeX support.
    - Mermaid diagram support.

<br/>

- Now, equally, for admins they should be able to:
  - Delete users.
  - Delete posts.
  - Perform personalized queries on posts and users.
